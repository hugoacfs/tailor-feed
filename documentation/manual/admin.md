# Admin Menu

The admin menu consists of **4 tabs** - 3 tables and 1 menu.

 - A **sources** table - to *update*/*add*/*disable* sources.
 - A **topics** table - to *update*/*add*/*remove*/*disable* topics.
 - An **articles** table - to *delete* articles.
 - A **cron** menu - to turn *chronological* jobs *on* or *off*.

## Navigation

The admin menu has its own **navigation side bar**, which can be toggled *on* or *off*. The navigation allows you to change between *tables*/*menus*.

## Sources Table

The sources table has basic built in navigation.  

> **Note:** The same **navigation method** is available for all tables.

The **blue** buttons allow for **editing** the sources details. The **eye** symbol on the *far right side* of the table represents if a source is **visible** or **not**. By clicking the eye symbol, you can **toggle it off or on**.

To add a **new source**, click the big **green** button that says - *Add a new source*.

The **table** symbol on each **source** shows the **article** table for each *specific source* when clicked.

## Topics Table

The topics table has basic built in navigation.

The **topics** table has the *same functionality as the sources* table, the only difference being topics can be **permanently removed** by clicking on the **red** buttons.

> **Note:** After removing a topic, any **subscriptions** to that topic, and **links between the articles and the topic** will be **lost**. The articles will **not** be deleted, just no longer *associated with the topic* even if previously associated.

## Articles Table

The articles table has basic built in navigation.

The basic **pagination** of the articles table *interferes* with the **search** functionality - this means to properly search the articles, make sure to tick **All** from the **Showing**: option on the top right.

The only *admin functionality* of articles is to **permanently delete** articles from the *database*.

> **Note:** Remember this will **delete any link to any topic** there might be. It will also **delete media such as images or video**.

## Cron Menu

The cron menu, too, has basic built in navigation, but it might not work as expected.

The only supported functionality of the **cron** menu is to turn **on** or **off** the *cron jobs.* Any other issues will have to be dealt with by a **system admin**.

> **Note:** This functionality is still under development, certain issues might occur. Please report them to a system administrator.
