Tailor-\/feed is a news aggregation tool built on P\+HP. It utilises social media as a source of news, aggregating these on a DB for displaying on the browser in the desired format.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It currently only supports \mbox{\hyperlink{class_twitter}{Twitter}} as a news\textquotesingle{} source, but other social media platforms might be integrated in the future.
\item Tailor-\/feed has some admin functionality and enables some control over adding/removing sources and topics. It also enables removal of articles.
\item Tailor-\/feed is ideal for organisations which aim to improve internal communication channels by using social media, but want to offer an alternative to using personal social media accounts, as well as collating all of their official social media account feeds together for the users or guests.
\item Personalisation is the focus of Tailor-\/feed, letting users subscribe in and out of sources or topics, building their own timelines.
\item Tailor-\/feed offers basic authentication, it is advised you implement your own, or make changes.
\end{DoxyItemize}



 

Tailor-\/feed is still under development, and a stable version is not yet ready.
